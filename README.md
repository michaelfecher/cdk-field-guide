# cdk-field-guide
This repository is having examples in AWS CDK for (hopefully) sophisticated, clean and end-to-end approaches.


## How to run it
In most of the cases, I provided a package for it, which is completely executable.
In trivial examples, you still find the source within a package.

Generally, install all packages via from the root

```
npx lerna bootstrap
```

# Source
More explanations about the examples will be released in the near future on
